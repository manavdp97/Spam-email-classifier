The file lenet_mnist.py contains my implementation of LeNet 5 used to train on MNIST.

Usage:

	python lenet_mnist.py <epochs>

Example:
	
	python lenet_mnist.py 5

Note:
In general the network is able to reach about 97% accuracy on test set by the end of 
the 1st epoch and and about 98.5% by the end of 5th epoch. Therefore, training for 
around 5 epochs is optimal.
